# Searching for new heavy neutral gauge bosons using vector boson fusion processes at the LHC
---
### Questions

1. What's Sequential standard model?
2. 



### Review

Search of Z' in the taotaojfjf and muonmuonjfjf channels

Process: Z'->muon muon 

-Pt, why is important?
-Z' symmetry particle of Z
-dilepton pair : A combination of the particle and antiparticle forms of two leptons of the same flavour.
-weak interaction 

### TODO

- Feyman diagrams
- What is VBF production
